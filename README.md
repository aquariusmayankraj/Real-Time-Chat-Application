# Real-Time Chat Application

This **Real-Time Chat Application** is built using **Spring Boot** and **WebSockets**, designed to provide instant communication between multiple users. It demonstrates how WebSocket connections can be managed in a scalable and efficient way with Java and Spring.  

The application allows users to join a chat room and exchange messages instantly without page reloads. Messages are broadcast to all connected clients in real-time, ensuring smooth and continuous interaction. The front-end is simple yet responsive, built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, making it lightweight and user-friendly.  

On the backend, **Spring WebSocket with STOMP protocol** manages the messaging system. The application is structured to handle multiple users concurrently, while maintaining low latency. This project also highlights the use of Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration, dependency management (Maven/Gradle), and modular design for easier scalability.  

This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn how to integrate WebSockets with Spring Boot for real-time features. It can be extended to include authentication, private chat rooms, message persistence with databases, and advanced features like file sharing.  

**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, Java, WebSocket (STOMP), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
