## Introduction üìù

The **Real-Time Chat Application** is built using **Spring Boot** and **WebSockets**, providing instant communication between multiple users.  
It demonstrates how WebSocket connections can be managed efficiently using Java and Spring, enabling real-time message broadcasting without page reloads.  

The application features a simple, responsive front-end using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**, ensuring a lightweight and user-friendly experience.  

On the backend, **Spring WebSocket with STOMP protocol** handles real-time messaging, supporting multiple concurrent users while maintaining low latency.  
This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn how to integrate WebSockets with Spring Boot. It can be extended with authentication, private chat rooms, database persistence, and advanced features like file sharing.
